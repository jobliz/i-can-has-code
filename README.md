I made this repository because I grew tired of having all my exploratory programming scattered across different folders on my hard drive. Nuking that kind of mess and forcing me to have some order is what GitHub's for!

I will be uploading my stuff in the next days. It is mostly in python, node.js and clojure. Stay tuned!
