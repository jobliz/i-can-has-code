I made this repository because I grew tired of having all my exploratory programming scattered across different folders on my hard drive. Nuking that kind of mess and forcing me to have some order is what GitHub's for!

I will be organizing and uploading my stuff in the following days. It mostly consists of me playing with the languages, their libraries, or solved Project Euler problems. Stay tuned!
