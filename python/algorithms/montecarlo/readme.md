1946: John von Neumann, Stan Ulam, and Nick Metropolis, all at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, cook up the Metropolis algorithm, also known as the Monte Carlo method. The Metropolis algorithm aims to obtain approximate solutions to numerical problems with unmanageably many degrees of freedom and to combinatorial problems of factorial size, by mimicking a random process. Given the digital computer’s reputation for deterministic calculation, it’s fitting that one of its earliest applications was the generation of random numbers.

"Monte Carlo methods" is a term covering pretty much any use of pseudo-randomness to help solve any kind of problem. Apparently, Monte Carlo is an old name for what is now commonly known as a roulette wheel, hence the relation to randomness. One of the fascinating examples of a Monte Carlo simulator described in Fooled by Randomness is the use of pseudo-random numbers to calculate an approximation of the value of Pi. Imagine a dart board inside of a square. If you throw darts, in a random fashion, at the square, counting the number of darts which land on the dart board versus the number which land on the square, you can approximate Pi with some simple arithmetic.
