The "old" directory contains how I solved some problems years ago, mostly by using brute force, tabs instead of spaces and weird spacing, so they are innefficient AND ugly. I will upload them as the newer versions that reflect my current skill come along, keeping the oldies for sentimental reasons =)

Functions made to solve particular problems, in chronological order as they appear:

* Problem 002: fibonacci generators
* Problem 003: isprime, crude prime generator and prime factorization
* Problem 004: palindrome lambda
* Problem 005: greatest common divisor and least common multiple
* Problem 007: nth result of a generator
* Problem 008: numberstring to secuential left-to-right n-digit generator 
* Problem 009: float equals int lambda and hypothenuse lambda
* Problem 010: sieve of Eratosthenes
